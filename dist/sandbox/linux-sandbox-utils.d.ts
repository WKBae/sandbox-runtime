 * Linux network sandboxing uses bwrap --unshare-net which creates a completely isolated

 *
 * 1. Host side: Run socat bridges that listen on Unix sockets and forward to host proxy servers
 *    - HTTP bridge: Unix socket -> host HTTP proxy (for HTTP/HTTPS traffic)
 *    - SOCKS bridge: Unix socket -> host SOCKS5 proxy (for SSH/git traffic)
 *
 * 2. Sandbox side: Bind the Unix sockets into the isolated namespace and run socat listeners
 *    - HTTP listener on port 3128 -> HTTP Unix socket -> host HTTP proxy
 *    - SOCKS listener on port 1080 -> SOCKS Unix socket -> host SOCKS5 proxy
 *
 * 3. Configure environment:
 *    - HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:3128 for HTTP/HTTPS tools
 *    - GIT_SSH_COMMAND with socat for SSH through SOCKS5
 *
 * LIMITATION: Unlike macOS sandbox which can enforce domain-based allowlists at the kernel level,
 * Linux's --unshare-net provides only all-or-nothing network isolation. Domain filtering happens
 * at the host proxy level, not the sandbox boundary. This means network restrictions on Linux
 * depend on the proxy's filtering capabilities.

 * UNIX SOCKET BLOCKING (APPLY-SECCOMP):
 * This implementation uses a custom apply-seccomp binary to block Unix domain socket
 * creation for user commands while allowing network infrastructure:
 *
 * The two stages are described in README.md, "Unix Socket Restrictions
 * (Linux)".
 *
 * This solves the conflict between:
 * - Security: Blocking arbitrary Unix socket creation in user commands
 * - Functionality: Network sandboxing requires socat to call socket(AF_UNIX, ...) for bridge connections
 *
 * The seccomp-bpf filter blocks socket(AF_UNIX, ...) syscalls, preventing:
 * - Creating new Unix domain socket file descriptors
 *
 * It also blocks socket(AF_VSOCK, ...): the network namespace does not fence
 * VM sockets, so one would reach out of the sandbox past the proxies.
 *
 * Security limitations:
 * - Does NOT block operations (bind, connect, sendto, etc.) on inherited Unix socket FDs
 * - Does NOT prevent passing Unix socket FDs via SCM_RIGHTS
 * - For most sandboxing use cases, blocking socket creation is sufficient
 *
 * The filter allows:
 * - All TCP/UDP sockets (AF_INET, AF_INET6) for normal network operations
 * - All other syscalls
 *
 * PLATFORM NOTE:
 * The allowUnixSockets configuration is not path-based on Linux (unlike macOS)
 * because seccomp-bpf cannot inspect user-space memory to read socket paths.
 *
 * Requirements for seccomp filtering:
 * - Pre-built apply-seccomp binaries are included for x64 and ARM64
 * - Pre-generated BPF filters are included for x64 and ARM64
 * - Other architectures are not currently supported (no apply-seccomp binary available)
 * - To use sandboxing without Unix socket blocking on unsupported architectures,
 *   set allowAllUnixSockets: true in your configuration
 * Dependencies are checked by checkLinuxDependencies() before enabling the sandbox.
 *
 * CALLER OBLIGATION: the euid and capability decisions behind the returned
 * string are made here, in the process that builds it, so the string must be
 * run by a process with the same euid and the same capability bounding and
 * inheritable sets.
